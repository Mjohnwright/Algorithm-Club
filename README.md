# Algorithm-Club
That algorithm and data structure jawn!

Just a bunch of Philadelphia coders with a whiteboard in a coffee shop or bar. We meet 2x/month. Hereâ€™s the idea: solve data structure, algorithm, and JS puzzles together--no IDEs, no CLI, no StackOverflow. Examples from places like Code Wars, Code Fights, FreeCodeCamp algorithm practice, Cracking the Coding Interview, recent interviews, etc. Low pressure, good company, great practice.

## How to Prepare

For each meeting, prepare at least one algorithm or data structure question, something you feel like you can confidently break down to the group. You'll present it as a word problem, talk about how you'd solve it, and then others can step in with their own solutions/ideas. It's definitely okay if we overlap (e.g., multiple people have a great prompt for bubble sort or binary search)--we're mostly concerned with practicing the process of talking about programming out loud, especially more abstract ideas, but also language trivia (like, what's a closure? Recursion? Hoisting?).

## Sync This Repository

To keep up-to-date, I recommend that you watch and/or fork this repository, as it's updated regularly to keep track with what we cover in Algorithm Club.

To configure a remote that points to the upstream repository (bunsushi/Algorithm-Club):

```$ cd <this-repository>```

```$ git remote -v```

You should see your own fork as the origin:

```origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Algorithm-Club.git (fetch)```

```origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Algorithm-Club.git (push)```

Add the upstream repository:

```$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/bunsushi/Algorithm-Club.git```

Now, when you want to sync your repository to this original repository:

```$ git pull upstream master```
